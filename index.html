    <h1>Towers Of Hanoi</h1>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <div>Simply put, the goal is to get the rings, however many there may be, from the starting position 
                (tower) to the end position (tower) in the same order that the rings were origionally placed in. 
                There are typically three towers, a starting tower, a central tower to help distribute movements,
                 and an end tower. In my edition there is no explicit "end" tower, either two of the origionally 
                 empty towers can act as an "end" or a central". Upon moving the rings, you will see they descend 
                 in width from top to bottom. `You cannot place a ring of greater width on top of a ring with smaller 
                 width when trying to move, if a movement is made, the ring being placed must be smaller than the 
                 ring underneath it or the tower must be empty on placement. The only rings that can be moved are 
                 the highest rings on any given tower, if the ring is not at the highest point on the tower it cannot 
                 be moved.` Once the rings are succesfully placed from the starting tower for an alternative tower in 
                 the same starting order (from smallest to largest), the game has been won. </div>

            <div>Best to play (and view) on a laptop screen or something larger than 1400px wide. The game is configured
                for multiple screen sizes but if you want the most pleasant expirience and most accurate to the final build
                ... just play on desktop. Who plays phone games anymore anyways. <br> { but if anyone wants to buy a level 11 Town Hall message me }
