### How to play Towers of Hanoi
# Simply put, the goal is to get the rings, however many there may be, from the starting position (tower) to the end position (tower) in the same order that the rings were origionally placed in. There are typically three towers, a starting tower, a central tower to help distribute movements, and an end tower. In my edition there is no explicit "end" tower, either two of the origionally empty towers can act as an "end" or a central". Upon moving the rings, you will see they descend in width from top to bottom. You cannot place a ring of greater width on top of a ring with smaller width when trying to move, if a movement is made, the ring being placed must be smaller than the ring underneath it or the tower must be empty on placement. The only rings that can be moved are the highest rings on any given tower, if the ring is not at the highest point on the tower it cannot be moved. Once the rings are succesfully placed from the starting tower for an alternative tower in the same starting order (from smallest to largest), the game has been won.
